# Steps II

6. Click on "Continue to checkout".

7. Fill in the required information and click "Continue". You must use your real email and phone number since you will get an activation link + code. 

If you get the chance, then select "I want one.com to administrate my *** domains." 

In your case it means that when you wish to terminate the domain you allow one.com to do it on your behalf rather than you having to contact another company to do it.

Take a break! It can take up to an hour before you get the domain. 

You will receive an email from Punktum.dk asking you to activate your new domain. The email includes your user id and password details. You must complete this activation if you want to use the domain. If you do not activate the domain, the MX and TXT records will not propagate and will remain pending indefinitely.
